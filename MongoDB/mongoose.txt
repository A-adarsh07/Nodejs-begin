Now we are going to use mongoose rather than mongodb
Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling(ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js 
Mongoose is like a translator between your Nodejs code and MongoDB . It makes working with the database smoother and easier

Mongoose as a driver is better than a native official driver -mongodb

Mongoose helps you make sure the data you put into the database is correct. Its like having someone check if you've written your email address correctly before sending a message.
very easy to query from the databases


install mongoose library using npm 
npm i mongoose

import Mongoose and define the MongoDB URL - in the db.js file ,first import the mongoose library and 
define the URL to your MongoDB database.
